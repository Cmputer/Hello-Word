# Hello-Word
Click on this Repository and navigate to the **README.md** file to learn how to utilize this GitHub and create your own!


## Description
This repositiory contains a HelloWorld.java file. This is a simple GitHub repo that is supposed to show how one looks and
explain how to clone this repo onto your own GitHub. Once you do this and understand the Git commands, you will be able to 
make your own private repos to display your work. 


## Getting Started - Cloning this Repository
The following links will help you understand how to clone this repository to your own. Read through each section carefully to
understand what you are making and how to clone this repository to your own page. Once you think you have cloned it correctly,
try running the program to see if it works.

## World of GitHub
There is so much to learn when it comes to making a proper GitHub. If you would like to continue to add to your profile and 
grow your knowledge of GitHub, you can review the rest of the website linked below. This will cover most everything there is to
know about using Git and will be especially helpful when starting out.

## Building your Profile
A good way to stay organized as well as maintain your GitHub efficently is to create **ONE** file that holds all of your individual repositories. For example, you would create a file called **GitHub** for example and then have all of your repos each set up 
separately in that same file. You could do this first creating a new empty repository on GitHub. Then, by simply typing 
**git clone 'repo link'**. Then you can add files to those individual folders. To finish you can type **git add .**, then type 
**git commit -m "enter a message"**, and finally type **git push origin main** to push the updates to your empty GitHub repository.

Your GitHub is simular to your resume in the way that it is everchanging. These steps listed above are so that you can get the
ground work for creating your GitHub. After this, all you will be doing is reiterating these steps of cloning an empty repository 
to one file, adding files to it, and pushing it to main.
